Hello! My name is Zachary Cimorelli I am a Junior studying computer science. So far I have taken most of the sequential computer science courses (CPS 1, 2, and 3). Last semester I took Assembly Language, which I did kind of enjoy. I liked the challenge some of the concepts presented and I did really well in it. I started dabbling in web development last semester by following some online courses but that fell off as the semester progressed. I am really excited to take this course becuase web development is something that I am actually interested in.

I hope that with the skills I develop in this class I am able to work on projects of my own. Something I would like to challenge myself with using these skills is developing a finance tracker that is able to track my own bank accounts. I also hope this lays down a foundation for me to build upon to do this professionally.

Also I don't always look like I do in the picture above. I just like the picture because I think its funny and I hope you do too!
